This is the third party dependencies directory for Code_TYMPAN 4.1.5

You need to download the archive Code_TYMPAN-4.1.5_third-party-NN.zip
from https://extranet.logilab.fr/static/TYMPAN/files/ and uncompress
it in this directory (where NN is the version number of the archive,
currently NN=01) :

https://extranet.logilab.fr/static/TYMPAN/files/Code_TYMPAN-4.1.5_third-party-01.zip

This archive should contain :
 * an INSTALL file
 * a checksum.md5 to check the MD5 sum of each ZIP file
 * gtest-1.6.0.zip : the testing framework
 * yams++-0.1.1.zip : a tool for handling data models in C++
 * dime-137851b034f6.zip: Dime library to read DXF files (i.e. AutoCAD files)

                                        (for old sphinx versions)

Note about Dime: there is not tagged version. Thus, the name is followed by the
SHA1 of the changeset. For now, Logilab forked the Dime project on Bitbucket at
https://bitbucket.org/garaud/dime in order to write CMake files. Logilab asked
to the official project at https://bitbucket.org/Coin3D/dime to apply these
modifications. We will updated this note and the related SHA1 when it is the
case.

Please note that the following major dependencies are not provided by
this archive as they are better installed in a system dependent way :
 * Qt >= 4.6
 * CMake >= 2.8
 * Boost >= 1.46
 * CGAL >= 4.0.2
